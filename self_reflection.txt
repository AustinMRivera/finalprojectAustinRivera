Self-Reflection on Final Project

For this project, I built a network monitoring app in Python using Flask and other basic libraries. It aligns with my computer networking concentration by focusing on device discovery, ping monitoring, and data enrichment via API.

What Worked Well:
- The scanning logic using subprocess for pings was straightforward and reliable for local networks.
- Integrating SQLite helped with persisting data, allowing historical views, which added value.
- The dashboard came out clean with Bootstrap, and adding Chart.js for simple line charts was a good way to visualize ping times without too much complexity.
- Email alerts via smtplib worked as a basic notification system.

Challenges and Improvements from Feedback:
- Based on the professor's feedback to make it robust, I expanded from the outline by adding features like device naming and charts. This made it feel more complete, but I had to debug API errors for private IPs (they return 'bogon' which I handle by showing a message).
- One issue was parsing ping output consistently across OSes; I added try-except to gracefully handle it.
- The app handles errors like bad API tokens or failed pings without crashing, showing user-friendly messages.

Lessons Learned:
- Modularizing code (separate files for scanning, DB, API) made it easier to maintain and debug.
- Working with networking concepts like subnets and pings reinforced class topics.
- For future, I'd add user auth for the admin part or real-time updates, but that might be overkill here.

Overall, this project demonstrates practical networking monitoring while being efficient in code. I'd rate my implementation as solid for the course level.
