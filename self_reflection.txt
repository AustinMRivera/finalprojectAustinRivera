Self-Reflection on Final Project

For my final project, I created a small network-monitoring app in Python using Flask and a few basic libraries. It fits well with my networking concentration because it focuses on finding devices on a network, checking their ping status, and pulling extra details from an API.

What Went Well
- Using SQLite made it easy to save results so I could view older data.
- The dashboard turned out nice using Bootstrap, and Chart.js let me show simple ping graphs without making things complicated.
- Basic email alerts through smtplib worked well enough for notifications.

Challenges and Feedback
- After the suggestion of ensuring it was more robust, I added a few extra features, like device names and charts. These additions helped, but I ran into issues with the API returning useless info for private IPs. I ended up handling that by showing a clear message instead of an error.
- Ping output isn’t always the same across operating systems, so I added try-except blocks to avoid crashes.
- I also made sure the app could handle things like bad API keys or failed pings without breaking, and instead show a message.

What I Learned
- Splitting the code into separate files for scanning, the database, and the API made the project easier to work with.
- It is important to plan out what you are going to do before just jumping in to save time in the long run.
- Real data is messy; dealing with real data does not always come across clean.

Overall, this project provided great additional hands-on experience that will be very valuable to have in this field.
